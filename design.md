## Technical Specifications

Chosen token standard: ERC721

Chosen governance process model: Anyone with the corresponding type of token can vote through this system where three choices of voting are provided: for, against, and abstain. When the votes are cast, the system will count the number of each option and if the number of "for" outweighs that of "against" the voting will succeed.
